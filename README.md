# Intro

  In Endless Dungeon, you will follow the path of an adventurer and see through his eyes as he decimates his foes. With different classes and several advantages and disadvantages that come with these classes, you will have many ways to (try to) survive the Endless Dungeon. You may find certain items to help you on your journey, but will they be enough to keep you alive? You may feel stronger with each enemy that you kill, but for how long will you be able to keep killing them?
  
  The Endless Dungeon awaits, with endless opportunities as well as endless dangers. Are you up for the challenge?

# Gameplay
