	
	In Endless Dungeon, you will be faced with waves of monsters.
Your goal is to kill them all.

To play, you select an enemy by clicking on it, and then press "Attack" or
choose a skill from the buttons at the bottom of the screen.
You can attack one enemy each turn, and they will hit back.
When you clear all three, you will get to the next stage.
You will gather experience and when you have enough you will level up.
Next to some bosses you will see their special type,
which will make them more or less vulnerable to some of your skills.
Enemies also drop some items at random, which will help you at your quest.
